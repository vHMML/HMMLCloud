# HMML Cloud

[HMML Cloud] (https://www.hmmlcloud.org) is a IIIF hosting service developed by the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library that also can include a simple application that allows digitization and cataloging projects to make their collections visible and searchable to the public.

HMML Cloud draws on the software expertise and cataloging methods used to operate vHMML Reading Room. HMML Cloudâ€™s database uses simplified best practices for cataloging along with HMML's digital preservation system for images to create an "out of the box" online catalog for digitized manuscripts where users can add/edit records and view these collections.

HMML Cloud provides a long-term preservation model for external projects short of funding, while fulfilling HMML's mission to save manuscript culture around the world through its ability to store manuscript digital data.
